What:
I suggest shortening the time required for long pressing an entry before dragging it. In my experience, I use dragging a lot, but the long press time feels too long, which negatively affects the editing experience. Reducing this time would significantly speed up the editing process.

Why:
This adjustment would improve editing efficiency, making it easier and faster to move items around without having to wait for the long press. It would create a smoother and more responsive experience for users who frequently use the drag-and-drop function.

When:
This change would be especially useful for users who frequently engage in task editing, where quick rearrangement of entries is essential.
-----------------------------------------
What:
I would also like to request the addition of a "Favorites" and "Merge Group" feature. This would allow users to save one or more related entries and their contents together in a group. For example, when I’m adding sound effects, particle effects, and titles for task acceptance and completion, it would be extremely helpful to save these three entries as a group. Then, I could easily access them from the "Favorites" whenever needed, saving a significant amount of time.

Why:
This feature would streamline workflows by allowing users to save and quickly access related items, reducing the need to repeatedly configure them from scratch.

When:
This would be particularly useful when managing multiple related entries for recurring tasks, especially when frequent editing and adjustments are needed.
------------------------------------------
Thank you for considering my suggestions! I believe these improvements would greatly enhance the overall user experience.

Wow, Winston, you're quite smart.

1.I think long pressing reduces my editing efficiency, especially when I need to copy entries in bulk. This is one of the reasons I suggested the second feature. I believe the long press mechanism could be removed and replaced with a mode where I can simply select with the left mouse button and immediately drag the entry.

2.I believe I’ve been quite detailed in explaining, but when I need to edit a large number of repeated entries, the "Favorites" and "Merge Group" features would be extremely useful. For example, I could create a group named "quest_start" and add the "sound effects -> particle effects -> titles" that I mentioned earlier. Then, when I need to add the same start effects to other tasks, I could just take this group and reuse it directly.

Winston, your question actually reminded me that I would like to see a "Copy Entry" feature, rather than just "link with duplicate." Right now, when I want to copy an entry, I first use "link with duplicate," then drag and unlink them, and finally drag it to the entry I want to link with. During this process, the long press drag feels awkward and choppy.
