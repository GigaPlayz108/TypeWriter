# Conditional NPC showing
:::warning[NPC created]
In this tutorial, we assume you already have created an entity.\
If you haven't done that yet, please follow the [entity extension tutorial](./index.mdx) first.
:::
In this tutorial, you will learn how to conditionally show an entity using audiences.

## Adding an audience entry
There are a lot of different audience entries available. For this tutorial, we will use cinematic audience, but all others have similar features.


Firstly, click on the + icon in the top right corner of the panel and search for `New Cinematic Audience`. Add it to your page by clicking on the + icon.

<EntrySearch entryName="cinematic_audience"/>

## Adding it onto your entity instance.
Now hold your entity instance and drag it onto the `New Cinematic Audience` entry. This will link the audience to the entity.

It should now look something like this:

<Image img={require("../../assets/entity-extension/audience-entity-link.png")} alt="Audience Entity Link" width={400} />

## Configuring the audience
Inside the audience entry, there are 2 fields:
* **Cinematic**: This is the cinematic that the audience will be linked to.
* **Inverted**: This will invert the audience, meaning that the entity will only be shown when the audience is not met.
