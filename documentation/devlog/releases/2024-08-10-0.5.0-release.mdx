## Manifest Entries
Manifest entries are entries that automatically do stuff based on the environment. Think of showing NPCs based on filters (such as quest status) and having NPC holograms. Boss bars, Creating scoreboards, Interaction zones, and much more!

_For the programmers under us, where sequence entries are like imperative programming. Manifest entries are declarative programming. They can be linked in an acyclic-directional graph._

### Audience Entries
The first subclass of Manifest Entries are Audience Entries.
They display anything to the player, Such as a boss bar. There is a special variety of audience entries, which are AudienceFilterEntries. They filter out players, such as regions, if they are in a certain part of a quest, if they are in a cinematic...
These types of filters can be chained to have extreme customizability and flexibility.

## Entity Adapter
Say goodbye to the old NPC adapters like Citizens, FancyNpcs, and ZNPCs. The Entity Adapter allows you to define entities directly within Typewriter, empowering you to use them in cinematics, control their visibility based on conditions (like during a quest segment), and even have them navigate and exhibit complex behaviors. With full control, the sky is the limit!

## Grouped Facts
The value of a fact can now be set for a group of players. 
For example, you can now check if a party of players have killed a certain number of enemies.

## Documentation Improvements
Some of you may have already looked at the new documentation. 
We've made major improvements to the documentation. All to make it easier to use and understand Typewriter.

## Switched from ProtocolLib to PacketEvents
This switch has allowed many new features in Typewriter, like the new buttery smooth camera cinematics. It means that now you need to install PacketEvents in order for Typewriter to work.

## Made some breaking API changes 
There are various breaking API changes for Adapters. To view the migration, take a look at the [Migration Guide](https://docs.typewritermc.com/develop/adapters/api-changes/0.5.0)

:::danger[Deprecation Warning]
With this release, we're marking the old NPC adapters, such as ZNPCs and FancyNpcs, as deprecated. This means that while they will still function in the current version, this will be the last release where they are supported. Though only the files added here will work. Going forward, we'll only be providing bug fixes for the Citizens NPC adapter. It will remain updated primarily to assist new users in getting started, but we strongly encourage everyone to transition to the Entity Adapter for the best Typewriter experience.
